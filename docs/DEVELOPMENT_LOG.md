### Worked On
Initial project inception, architectural specification, database schema formalization, communication protocol design, and ADR documentation for the backend-first intelligent local music player.

### Changes
- Created `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` specifying the backend-heavy modular monolith, threading model, and component interactions.
- Created `docs/BACKEND.md` detailing the module layout, `CoreProcessor` lifecycle, error hierarchies, and background task system.
- Created `docs/DATABASE.md` defining the complete SQLite relational schema (17 entities + FTS5 virtual table) and database PRAGMA performance tuning.
- Created `docs/EVENTS.md` cataloging all `Command`, `Event`, and `Query` variants with payload semantics.
- Created ADRs:
  - `0001-use-rust.md`: Rust for backend core logic.
  - `0002-use-tauri.md`: Tauri for thin presentation shell and typed IPC.
  - `0003-use-sqlite.md`: SQLite with `sqlx` for zero-maintenance local ACID persistence.
  - `0004-modular-monolith.md`: Modular monolith avoiding premature microservices.
  - `0005-central-processor-and-event-bus.md`: Central Processor + Tokio broadcast EventBus.
- Created `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md`, and `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`.

### Decisions
- Locked technology stack: Rust, Tauri, React + TypeScript, SQLite with `sqlx`.
- Prohibited business logic from residing in the frontend; all audio playback, scanning, ranking, and recommendation computation strictly lives in Rust.
- Encapsulated audio playback behind an `AudioBackend` trait and metadata extraction behind a `MetadataReader` / `MetadataProvider` trait.
- Non-blocking event broadcasting: EventBus gracefully succeeds with 0 receivers when no UI or internal components are actively subscribed.

### Problems
- Initial `sqlx` compilation error resolved by enabling the `macros` feature flag in `Cargo.toml`.
- Replaced missing `use std::str::FromStr;` import for `SqliteConnectOptions`.

### Phase 1 Implementation Summary
- Initialized Cargo workspace with `music-player-backend` crate.
- Configured SQLite embedded migrations with 17 relational tables and FTS5 search.
- Built `CoreProcessor` command dispatcher and query execution subsystem.
- Built `EventBus` backed by `tokio::sync::broadcast`.
- Validated via automated test suite in `tests/foundation_tests.rs` (all 5 tests passing).
- Validated via standalone headless CLI execution (`cargo run --bin music-player-cli`).

### Remaining Work
- Phase 2: Local music scanning with `lofty`, incremental indexing, and SQLite FTS5 search.
- Phase 3: Audio playback engine with `rodio` & `cpal`.
- Phases 4 - 9 as mapped in `ROADMAP.md`.

### Recommended Next Step
Proceed to **Phase 2: Local Music Library**, implementing the directory scanner, metadata extraction with `lofty`, change hashing, and Track/Artist/Album repositories.
